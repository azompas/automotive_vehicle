ABSTRACT

The subject of this thesis is the construction of an automotive vehicle who uses a circuit with sensors for detection and avoidance of obstacles. The issue of thesis is a fully functional, low scale, automotive vehicle (three wheel vehicle with one wheel free to move in any direction and separate move to the other two) with sensors for tracking obstacles. The sensors are attached to a microcontroller, which edits the data from the sensors and controls two dc motors, from the pwm pinouts, and so the vehicle moves without hitting any obstacles. If the microcontroller brakes the one motor, then all the device turns that way. The sensors and the dc motors are not straight attached to the microcontroller. The dc motors are connected to an H-bridge circuit which is controlled by the microcontroller from the pwm pinouts. The sensors of my device are photodiodes which are attached to the microcontroller's analog pinin with a voltage divider circuit. In my thesis, in the first part, are analysed distance measuring methods. In the second part, are analysed the operating modus of all types of sensors who can be used at the device for distance ranging and are listed optional connections to the microcontroller for each sensor. In the third part, are presented the microcontrollers with their inbuilt components with some of them being analysed such as analog to digital converters, digital to analog converters, RAM and ROM. In the forth part, is analysed the operating and constructing mode of the drive motor circuit, H-Bridge. Finally, in the fifth part, are listed experimental data of distance ranging with Photodiode sensors and the code for programming the microcontroller.
